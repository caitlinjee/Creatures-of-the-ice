The player's forename is a text that varies. The player's full name is a text that varies. 

When play begins: 
	now the command prompt is "What is your name? > ".

To decide whether collecting names: 
	if the command prompt is "What is your name? > ", yes; 
	no.

After reading a command when collecting names: 
	if the number of words in the player's command is greater than 5: 
		say "Please choose a shorter name"; 
		reject the player's command; 
	now the player's full name is the player's command; 
	now the player's forename is word number 1 in the player's command; 
	now the command prompt is ">"; 
	say "Welcome, [player's forename].[paragraph break]"; 
	say "[banner text]"; 
	move the player to the location; 
	reject the player's command.
	
Instead of looking when collecting names: do nothing.

Rule for printing the banner text when collecting names: do nothing.

Rule for constructing the status line when collecting names: do nothing.




When play begins: say "You can feel the chill biting at your fingertips before you open your eyes. Every inch of your exposed skin is covered by a layer of freezing air. You feel it seeping into your skin, your bones, your blood. You can’t breathe, every intake of breath feels like an icy stab on your lungs.

Your eyelids flutter open, but it's as if they’re still closed. It's like a cloth is covering your eyes. You feel trapped, there is no space to move your limbs. You can’t think, can’t remember who you are. As much as you try to grasp any of your frantic thoughts, only a single coherent word emerges above the pounding of your head.

[italic type]Cold, cold, cold…[roman type]

The surface in front of you slides open and you fall out, hitting the cold, hard floor. A bolt of pain shoots up your wrist where you landed on it. Around you, cold steam escapes into the air, slowly dissipating away. You try to look around, but the bright lights above are a stark contrast to the darkness that just enveloped you. Your eyes take a while to adjust to the blinding whiteness of everything around you...'"







Understand "who" or "what" or "when" or "where" or "why" or "how" or "who's" or "what's" or "when's" or "where's" or "why's" or "how's" as "[query]".

Understand "[query] [text]" as a mistake ("[story title] understands commands, such as '[command prompt]examine [a random thing that can be seen by the player]', but not questions. For more instructions, type HELP.").

A help-topic is a kind of value. Some help-topics are defined by the Table of Standard Instructions.

'[bold type]OPEN DOOR[roman type]' or '[bold type]EXAMINE TABLE[roman type]'. These are the commands you will use most often: [line break][line break]
'[bold type]look[roman type]' or '[bold type]l[roman type]' : Look around the room, repeat the description of the room.[line break]
'[bold type]examine[roman type] thing' or '[bold type]x[roman type] thing' : Look more closely at something, get a detailed description to learn more about it. [line break]
'[bold type]inventory[roman type]' or '[bold type]i[roman type]' : List everything in your inventory. [line break]
'[bold type]north', 'south', 'east', 'west', 'up', 'down[roman type]', etc., or '[bold type]n', 's', 'e', 'w[roman type]', etc. : Walk in other directions to move between rooms. [line break]"

A thing can be examined or unexamined. A thing is usually unexamined. Carry out examining something: now the noun is examined.

Taking inventory is acting confused. Looking is acting confused. Examining an examined thing is acting confused.

After acting confused for the third turn:

		say "[one of]You feel like you hear footsteps, but that might just be your imagination. [line break][or]You feel as if you're not alone, but you haven't seen any sign of life so far.[or]You feel a gnawing sense of unease, like someone is watching you.[at random]".
	






The Unknown is a room. "You’re in a small room. The whiteness of the walls almost hurts your eyes. Everything looks so cold, not unlike how you feel right now.

While you were freezing inside, the outside feels like just cool metal, far from the low temperature you were just trapped in. On the door is the number '7' written in black, almost hidden against the dark metallic surface."  Understand "coffin" and "object" as the pod. 

Instead of entering the pod:
	say "You don't really feel like going back in, since you did just fall out of it."

Understand "electronic wristband" as wristband.

After wearing a wristband:
	say "You pick up the wristband and put it on. Immediately, it adjusts itself to fit onto your wrist perfectly, reducing its size. It rotates itself so that the small lens is located below your palm. Light projects from the lens, and a little blue holographic interface shines flat on the surface of your palm, using it as a screen. Against the face of your hand, the display reads, [line break][line break][italic type]MINERVA PRIME[roman type][line break][line break] The words fade away, along with the holographic screen. You're left staring at your empty palm."
	
Instead of looking under the table:

The Library is a room. "[if unvisited] You enter a large room, filled with shelves upon shelves of books, all lined up in a few rows. Many books are arranged neatly on the shelves, hiding their knowledge within.  Soft lights dot the black ceiling. It’s dimmer than your room, but bright enough that you don’t have to strain your eyes. It already feels calmer than the invasive white that previously surrounded you. You can feel the warmer air wrapping around you, taking away the chill in your body.[line break][line break][italic type](Remember to type [bold type]'help'[roman type][italic type] if you get stuck.)[roman type][otherwise] The soft lights and the subtle scent of old books welcome you back into the room.[end if]" 


The mirror is in the Library. It is fixed in place. "Mounted on one of the walls is a large mirror.". The description is "It’s a normal mirror, with a golden frame. You look into it and step back in surprise. You don’t recognize the face in the mirror, and yet it’s somehow familiar. You raise your arms, and the figure in the mirror follows. You make a face, and your reflection makes the same face back. That confirms it, it’s you. You rack your brain for any memory of how you looked like, any memory at all.[line break][line break]Nothing.". Understand "large mirror" as mirror.

You feel bad about reading it, but there might be some useful information inside.". The printing is "You flip open the journal. There seems to be nothing written in the book, except for the first page. [if light level is high] It's just barely bright enough to make out the words written on the paper.[line break][line break] [italic type]I'm not sure what day it is, but Maega says it's been exactly 26 years and 240 days since we departed from Daedalus-4. Everything seems to be working properly, and they're all still suspended. We're still travelling according to schedule. It's going to be another... 300 years? Who knows if anything will go wrong in that amount of time, if something will hit us or something malfunctions. They've been treating me nicely so far, but I think that will change when we reach our destination. They've already hurt me a few times. For now, I can only write down my thoughts in this book, in hopes that they won't understand. Maybe I can talk to Maega later. Until next time. [line break][line break][player's forename][roman type] [otherwise] But, it's too dark to make out anything written on the paper. [end if]"

[line break][line break][italic type]Skathii[line break][line break]A roughly humanoid species with long slender limbs and short fat bodies, the Skathii are vegetarians, only eating fruit. Their skin has a light green tint, to help regulate their internal temperature, which is highly crucial on their home planet. They have a symbiotic relationship with a parasitic life-form living in their bodies, without which they are unable to move. Not much is known about their culture, except for the fact that they do not seem to worship any deity.[roman type]".

The creatures have to replace their cells often or their dead cells might hinder their ability to regulate their temperature. Not only can they heal themselves at a very fast rate, but they can also clone themselves under extreme circumstances. Their clones are nearly identical to them, if not for the fact that the clones don't retain most of the original creature's knowledge. Because of this, many members of their species have been captured to be studied and used for medical experiments.[roman type][line break]";

The Greenhouse is a room. "[if unvisited] It appears to be a greenhouse, but the denseness of flora make it seem like a forest, if not for the harsh artificial lighting hurting your eyes. It’s an immensely large room, you can’t see the ends of it. Plants of all kind, most of which you don’t recognize, fill your vision, stretching across the room. Flowers of all types decorate the room, like a symphony of colours. In the middle of the room is the biggest tree you've ever seen, you don't think you can even wrap your hands around the trunk. [line break][line break] You look up and are filled with wonder. The ceiling is shaped like a dome, and it’s made of glass, letting you see the sky above. You didn't notice at first, but beyond the plants, one of the walls, and even the floor are made of glass too. You can only see black, blackness everywhere. Stars decorate the gaping dark emptiness outside, like the brushstrokes of an artist on an empty canvas. You can see the curved surface of a light blue planet far away, leaving virtually no doubt where you are. [line break][line break] Out in the middle of nothing, with the scent of nature around you, you feel at peace. [otherwise if the sphere is switched on]The warm humidity of the greenhouse has made your damp clothes stick uncomfortably to your back. Above, the empty space feels strangely comforting and yet suffocating at the same time. [line break][line break]The sphere suddenly beeps loudly a few times, then rolls to a wall of flowers. Its pink lights grow in intensity, it seems very interested in the flowers. [otherwise]  The warm humidity of the greenhouse has made your damp clothes stick uncomfortably to your back. Above, the empty space feels strangely comforting and yet suffocating at the same time.[end if]"



The glass door is an open door. The glass door is north of the Library and south of the Greenhouse. "A glass door leads [if the player is in the library]north. [otherwise]south.[end if]". The description is "You can see through the glass door into the next room, [if the player is in the library] filled with green plants. [otherwise] filled with books.[end if]"

The secret door is a locked door. It is east of the greenhouse and west of the Laboratory. The description is "A door, completely hidden by the thick wall of flora. You probably wouldn't have even found it if not for Maega or the sphere. It leads east.". Understand "hidden door" as secret door. The gold key unlocks the secret door.

Instead of unlocking secret door with gold key:
	say "You unlock the door. It opens, leading east.";
	now the secret door is unlocked.

After choosing notable locale objects: 
	Set locale priority of the secret door to 0.
	
Instead of examining the secret door when the sphere is switched off:
	say "You don't see any such thing."
	
Instead of opening the secret door when the sphere is switched off:
	say "You don't see any such thing."
	
Instead of going east in the Greenhouse when the sphere is switched off:
	say "You can't go that way."
	
Instead of examining the flower when the sphere is switched off:
	say "You don't see any such thing."
	


The flower is scenery in the Greenhouse. The odour is "The smell of earth, of plants, of dirt, fills your nose. A brief memory appears, but try as you might, you can’t grasp at it long enough to see it clearly. You only see flashes upon flashes… [line break] Hands covered with cool dirt, colourful leaves on the ground crunching beneath your feet… [line break] All at once, the flashes disappear. ". The description is "While examining the flowers, the sweet perfume fills your senses and you're hit with longing. One particularly dense wall of flowers catches your attention. It looks out of place somehow. Everything else is grown neatly, with all its imperfections cleared and trimmed. But you can notice now that it's slightly different from the other plants, more wild and unkempt. [line break][line break] Behind the flowers, there's a hidden door. You would have never found this on your own. [if cut]The flowers are less thick now, due to you cutting away some of them.[otherwise]A gold key is next to the door, tied down by the flowers.[end if]". Understand "flowers" as flower.

The plants is scenery in the Greenhouse. The description is "Plants of all kinds, as far as the eye can see."

The big tree is scenery in the Greenhouse. The description is "You can't help but be amazed at the size of the tree."

A staircase is a kind of door. A staircase is usually open. A staircase is seldom openable. 

The winding staircase is a staircase.  It is above the Greenhouse and below the Upper Greenhouse.  "[if the player is in the greenhouse]A winding staircase twisting around the big tree leads up, as if disappearing in the leaves.[otherwise] A winding staircase twisting around the big tree leads down.[end if]".  The description is "A large spiral staircase, made of glass.".

Instead of climbing a staircase: 
	try entering the noun.
	
The gold key is in the greenhouse. The description is "[if the flower is cut]The key is now on the floor.  [otherwise]The gold key is held tight by the flowers, you can't pull it out. You can't even begin to wonder how it grew around it like that.  [end if]". Understand "golden key" and "key" as the gold key.

Instead of taking the key when the flower is not cut:
	say "You try to pull away the flowers, but they've completely wrapped around the key. You should probably find another way to get rid of the flowers."

After choosing notable locale objects: 
	Set locale priority of the gold key to 0.
	
A blade is a kind of thing.

Understand "cut [something] with [something]" as cutting it with.

Instead of cutting something: 
	if a blade (called the edge) is held by the player, 
		try cutting the noun with the edge; 
	otherwise say "Your fingernails are not sharp enough."

Cutting it with is an action applying to two things.

Check cutting it with: 
	if the noun is not the flower, say "You don't feel that's wise." instead; 
	if the second noun is not a blade, say "[The second noun] is not sharp enough." instead.

Carry out cutting it with: 
	increment the count of cuts of the noun.

Report cutting it with: 
	say "You cut [the noun] with [the second noun]. Now the key is on the floor."
	
Definition: a thing is cut if the count of cuts of it > 0. A thing has a number called the count of cuts. 
	







The Upper Greenhouse is a room. "The staircase brings you closer to the dark nothingness above you. It's smaller up here than the lower level, like a balcony overlooking the top of the plants. You can look out into the sea of green, red, yellow, white, you can't even name all the colours. You feel like you can almost touch the blinking stars up here."

The scissors is a blade in the upper greenhouse. "A glint of light draws your eye to a pair of scissors sitting on a nearby table,". The description is "A pair of sharp scissors, probably for trimming leaves."

The bench is a enterable supporter in the upper greenhouse. "A bench is tucked among the plants." The description is "A simple marble bench, cool to the touch."

The little table is scenery in the upper greenhouse. The description is "A little table. Nothing odd about it.". Understand "table" as little table.

Instead of entering the bench:
	say "You take a seat on the bench to marvel at the wonders around you. The smell of nature filling your senses, the inky blackness of the sky above and below you, all fill you with a sense of peace. It's as if you're looking down on everything, on all of creation. With the limitless stretch of just... [italic type]life[roman type] facing you, you choose to rest for a little while longer."
	
Instead of looking under a bench:
	say "A little green frog stares back at you. Looking into its eyes, you decide to leave it alone."
	






The Small Nook is a room. "[if unvisited]It's a tiny room, much much smaller than the vastness of the Library. It seems like just a little nook, hidden behind the books. You can almost touch both walls beside you if you just stretch your arms. The room is almost devoid of anything, if not for a strange black sphere in the corner, which seems a bit out of place. The three walls facing you are also bare, the emptiness so different from the cluttered room you were just in. [line break][line break] Suddenly, the originally dark wall in front of you lights up like a screen. All at once, bright light fills the small room. You cover your eyes as a curtain of blue light covers your head to your feet. Then, it's gone. You see white words appear on the blue screen in front of you.

The sphere is a device in the Small nook. "A small sphere sits in the corner of the room." The description is "[if switched off]A black sphere, with the words SAM written on it.

The opening is a door. It is east of the Library and west of the Small nook. "An opening in the wall leads to the [if player is in the library]east. [otherwise] west.[end if]". The description is "An arch-topped opening, like a hole in the wall.".

After choosing notable locale objects:

The grey surface of the tables around you reflect the lights on the ceiling. One table is scattered with medical instruments, while another has beakers of chemicals and various scientific equipment. There are a few cupboards in the room. Through the glass doors, you can see various glass beakers, test tubes and measuring cylinders. In one corner of the room, there's a raised platform of some kind on the ground, something like a round stage. It seems to be a strange machine, but you have no idea what is it."

Finally, you slow to a stop, your heart sinking. A wall of vines prevents you from going any further. Dead end, nowhere to go. With no other choice, you turn to face yourself.

Breathless, you let [player's forename] grab onto your arm. Maybe it was your imagination, but you think you saw a hint of unease on their face as they pull out a syringe and sink it into your neck.

Suddenly, you feel a sharp pain in your neck. All too late, you hear the soft rustle of leaves behind you. Too late, too late, you didn't notice [player's forename] silently coming next to you.
