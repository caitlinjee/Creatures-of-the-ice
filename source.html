Not only can they heal themselves at a very fast rate, but they can also clone themselves under extreme circumstances. Their clones are nearly identical to them, if not for the fact that the clones don't retain most of the original creature's knowledge.

It's not that big of a room, and everything looks to be in its place. The grey surface of the tables around you reflect the lights on the ceiling. One table is scattered with medical instruments, while another has beakers of chemicals and various scientific equipment. There are a few cupboards in the room. Through the glass doors, you can see various glass beakers, test tubes and measuring cylinders. In one corner of the room, there's a raised platform of some kind on the ground, something like a round stage. It seems to be a strange machine, but you have no idea what is it.&quot;<span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">The tablet is in the Laboratory.

Or rather, the person you saw in the mirror. Some of them are of you handling beakers, some of you writing, some of you standing on the machine in the room, with a soft white glow coming from it. It's one of the final pictures that chills you. In it, you're lying on a table, with your eyes closed. But now, the colour of the face isn't green like in your reflection. The colour of its skin has changed to a light blue, but you're sure it's the same face, the same body. You're not sure why you feel a sense of dread from staring at that picture. <span class="comment">[line break]</span><span class="comment">[line break]</span> There's also a strange diagram showing what seems to be the machine in the room. It's labelled and what looks like instructions are written beneath the diagram, but you don't fully understand them. It seems that the machine can be used to isolate cells that can regenerate rapidly and replicate the biological data. There's also a function on the machine that lets it speed up cell regeneration by using a kind of light, but it hasn't been perfected yet.

Somehow you can understand what they're saying. <span class="comment">[line break]</span><span class="comment">[line break]</span>'<span class="comment">[player's forename]</span>, sedate the subject and return them to their cryo-chamber. Quickly.'<span class="comment">[line break]</span><span class="comment">[line break]</span><span class="comment">[player's forename]</span>? Are they talking to you? No... the one that looks like you responds. Nodding, they bend down to turn off the sphere. Its lights fade away, and the soft whirr of the motor becomes silent. They start to walk towards you. You stumble back and find yourself hitting the pod. You have to escape from <span class="comment">[player's forename]</span>. You have to do something. <span class="comment">[line break]</span>&quot;<span class="quote">;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">now the command prompt is </span>&quot;What will you do?

You hear a satisfying grunt behind you. You're not sure where to go, so you run to the biggest room you've seen so far. The greenhouse. Your footsteps beat on the ground, like thunder in your ears. They almost hide the sound of your pounding heart. You run into the dense plants, hoping they'll shield you away or at the very least hide you. <span class="comment">[line break]</span><span class="comment">[line break]</span>With every step, your legs ache, your lungs burn so, so much. But you keep running, running away from <span class="comment">[player's forename]</span>. You don't even know where you're going, your legs acting on their own. Finally, you come to a crossroads somewhere in the middle of the room. To the left, the plants are grown more thickly together with little space in between. It would be harder for them to see you, but it would also take more time for you to run away. To the right, there are fewer plants, and it would be quicker to run down this path, but there's the risk that they might see you and follow you.&quot;<span class="quote">;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">say line break;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">reject the player's command;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">if the player's command matches </span>&quot;hide&quot;<span class="quote">: </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">now the command prompt is </span>&quot;Do you continue hiding or run away?

You hear a satisfying grunt behind you. You're not sure where to go, so you run to the biggest room you've seen so far, hoping you can lose them and hide. The greenhouse. The freshness of the greenhouse would be welcoming if you weren't currently being chased.  As silently as possible, you dash into the dense plants, hoping they'll shield you away or at the very least hide you. You look around the room, scanning for any hiding places. You find a particularly large shrub, the colour matching the green tint of your skin. You think it's a suitable hiding spot, so you crouch down beneath it, hoping, hoping they won't find you. <span class="comment">[line break]</span><span class="comment">[line break]</span>Your sweat flows down your back, leaving a cold trail in its wake. You cover your mouth with your hand and hold your breath as the deafening pounding of your heart fills your head. You can hear faint footsteps near your hiding place. Trying not to move, you strain to listen to the sound. You can hear them, coming closer, closer still. Now you start to doubt if this hiding place is as good as you originally thought.&quot;<span class="quote">;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">reject the player's command;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">if the player's command matches </span>&quot;attack&quot;<span class="quote">: </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">now the command prompt is </span>&quot;You have a pair of scissors in your inventory.

You crouch down, trying to avoid the plants. The sharp tips of the branches snag on your clothes, cutting your face. You sweat drips into your eyes, stinging them. You wipe the sweat away from your forehead. The blood from your cuts comes off onto the back of your hands, the red a stark contrast against your green skin. You try to use your arms to block your face, but it does little to shield you from the branches. Still, you can feel your wounds healing themselves, your bleeding slowing until it stops.<span class="comment">[line break]</span><span class="comment">[line break]</span>You keep running, hoping the vast size of the room can help you lose your pursuer. Finally, you slow to a stop, your heart sinking. A wall of vines prevents you from going any further. Dead end, nowhere to go. With no other choice, you turn to face yourself. <span class="comment">[player's forename]</span>'s run turns into an easy walk. You desperately try to find any other way out, but every other direction is blocked by plants, and you're much too tired to put up any fight. Breathless, you let <span class="comment">[player's forename]</span> grab onto your arm. Maybe it was your imagination, but you think you saw a hint of unease on their face as they pull out a syringe and sink it into your neck. Helplessly, you try to fight against the drug as everything fades away...<span class="comment">[line break]</span><span class="comment">[line break]</span>You should fight it, but... do you?&quot;<span class="quote">;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">say line break;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">say run paragraph on;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">reject the player's command;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">if the player's command matches </span>&quot;Right&quot;<span class="quote">: </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">now the command prompt is </span>&quot;&gt;...&quot;<span class="quote">;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">say </span>&quot;There's no time to think, you choose the right path. Grateful that there are no plants to slow you down, you run as fast as you can. Your sweat trickles down your face, stinging your eyes. You're out of breath so fast, how long have you been trapped in that pod? With every gasp, the scent of nature fills your lungs. You would stop to enjoy it if you weren't being chased. Finally, you feel like you've been running long enough to lose them. You strain your ears to hear any footsteps. Nothing. Relieved, you let out a heavy breath. Suddenly, you feel a sharp pain in your neck. All too late, you hear the soft rustle of leaves behind you. Too late, too late, you didn't notice <span class="comment">[player's forename]</span> silently emerging from the plants next to you. In the corner of your eye, you notice the syringe slipping from their hand along with your own consciousness... <span class="comment">[line break]</span><span class="comment">[line break]</span>You should fight it, but... do you?<span class="comment">[line break]</span> &quot;<span class="quote">;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">say line break;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">say run paragraph on;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">reject the player's command;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">otherwise:</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">say </span>&quot;There are only two paths you can go now, you can't turn back.&quot;<span class="quote">;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">say line break;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">say run paragraph on;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">reject the player's command.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">After reading a command when the command prompt is </span>&quot;Do you continue hiding or run away?

There's nothing, no footsteps or rustling of leaves nearby. Finally, you exhale. You almost start to stand up when a hand suddenly wraps around your arm. You're pulled roughly to your feet and you find yourself face to face with <span class="comment">[player's forename]</span>. A hint of regret crosses their face before it's gone. They pull out a syringe from behind them and sink it into your neck. Your previously pounding heart slows down as your eyes close against their will...<span class="comment">[line break]</span><span class="comment">[line break]</span>You should fight it, but... do you?<span class="comment">[line break]</span>&quot;<span class="quote">;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">say line break;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">say run paragraph on;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">reject the player's command;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">if the player's command matches </span>&quot;Run away&quot;<span class="quote">: </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">now the command prompt is </span>&quot;&gt;...&quot;<span class="quote">;</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">say </span>&quot;You decide that you should just take your chances and run. As well hidden as you were, they still might find you. As quiet as you can, you start to quickly crawl away. Suddenly, you hear <span class="comment">[player's forename]</span> say something. You pause, then look over to them. They're talking to the other two people, but you're too far away to hear what they're saying. Fortunately, they didn't notice you. You continue crawling away. Suddenly, you feel a sharp pain on your palm and cry out in pain. Raising your hand, you find that you had accidentally put your hand on a fallen stem on the ground. Blood trickles out of the wound. The thorns on the stem are dark with your blood. Your wound starts to close, but it's too late. You look back and see them staring at you. It's useless to try to run now, you realise hopelessly. <span class="comment">[player's forename]</span> walks over to you and pulls you up. You think you can hear them whisper something when you feel a sharp pain on your neck. Your eyes grow heavy, you can't open them...

Annoyed, <span class="comment">[player's forename]</span> snatches the scissors away and grabs your arm. You struggle in their hold, but you're too weak. They hold your arms in place and take a syringe from behind your back. Helplessly, you struggle as they sink the needle into your neck.

However long you were in that pod didn't help in giving any strength to you. You see a spark of amusement in their eyes before they take out a syringe from behind their back. You're trapped between them and the pod behind you, there's nowhere to go now. They grab onto your arm. As much as you try to struggle, it's a useless gesture.
